## Credit Risk Analysis Repository

### Overview

This repository contains a machine learning-based approach to credit risk analysis. The goal of this project is to predict whether a loan application should be approved or denied based on various features related to the applicant's profile and financial history. 

### Algorithms Used

The credit risk analysis is implemented using several machine learning algorithms from the `scikit-learn` library:

- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
- Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

These algorithms are employed to build predictive models that can classify loan applications into approved or denied categories based on the provided features.

### Features Considered

The following features are considered in the credit risk analysis:

- Gender
- Education
- Marital Status
- Loan Amount
- Credit History
- Account Balance
- Property Area
- Dependents
- Employment Status

These features are used as input variables for training the machine learning models.

### Usage

To utilize this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kcchawla85/Credit_Risk_Assessment_Using_Machine_Learning
```

2. Install the required dependencies, including `scikit-learn`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Explore the dataset and the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to understand the data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation process.

4. Use the trained models to make predictions on new loan applications or evaluate their performance on test datasets.

### Contribution

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the credit risk analysis models, implementing additional algorithms, or enhancing the documentation, feel free to submit a pull request.
